# Introduction

I have been reading the most important of all Norwegian newspaper comics for close to 30 years.  

How Frode Ã˜verli has managed to keep PONDUS alive, I will not know but he has created something really, really special.

A middle-aged married father with a fondness for football (Liverpool), 70/80s hard rock (AC/DC) and with a sound disdain for pretentiousness, golf, pickles and the honesty of his local mechaniec - I mean - it just had success written all over it.

Oh - and he started life as a bus driver but took over his local pub and turned it in to Pondus Pub around 2010.

## Why this service?

The series has been a mainstay of both Dagbladet and later VG's comics portfolio but unfortunately, VG will only allow you to read the most recent one with paying a subscription and whilst I don't have a huge problem with paying for something, I can't just pay for the comics but basically have to pay for the whole premium news subscription plus they aren't really set up for non-Norwegian based consumers.

So...
